# Bash Battle Arena ðŸŽ®
Bash Battle Arena is a command-line game made to level up Bash skills in a fun, hands-on way. Players face a bunch of challenges that get trickier as they go, and the only way to beat them is by writing Bash scripts that actually work. Each challenge is like a game level, and with every win, players pick up new tricks and best practices.

**Objective:** The mission is simple-tackle tasks using Bash scripts. From moving files around to more tricky system stuff, the goal is to solve each challenge.
