# Level 6: Argument Parsing

# Mission: Write a script that accepts a filename as an argument and prints the number of lines in that file. If no filename is provided, display a message saying 'No file provided'.

#!/bin/bash
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    echo "No file provided"
    exit 1
fi

if [ ! -f "$1" ]; then
    echo "File not found!"
    exit 1
fi

LINE_COUNT=$(wc -l < "$1")
echo "The file '$1' has $LINE_COUNT lines."
